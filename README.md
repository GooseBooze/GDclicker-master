A CookieClicker clone made with godot 4 engine.
The project should include the most basic features from cookie clicker like the ability to click a button to increase a counter that will be used to buy "buildings" or "upgrades" so that you can gain money or in this case Cookies.
I also plan to have som form of background music and the ability to wipe all the save data.
There is also going to be an autosave feature that saves your progress.
