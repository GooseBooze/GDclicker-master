A CookieClicker clone made with godot 4 engine.

The goal is to create a simple game as a school project
The targeted audience is everyone, The game will be able to sit in the background for the player to check in once in a while and watch the numbers grow. It's pure seratonin (Fun chemicals)
It's functionality is as a game. You launch it and play it by clicking on different buttons.





The project should include the most basic features from cookie clicker like the ability to click a button to increase a counter that will be used to buy "buildings" or "upgrades" so that you can gain money or in this case Cookies.
I also plan to have som form of background music and the ability to wipe all the save data.
There is also going to be an autosave feature that saves your progress.


I made this project with the godot 4 engine, with the help of ai.
The reasoning for this is that godot is a simple application that i can easily learn how to use, and another student in class has experience in, so they cna teach me.
The use of ai is because i don't know gdscript and needed to learn gdscript, which in hindsight is as easy as learning most programming languages, i also needed it to speed up the project since my original project evaporated after easter and i was short on time. I have used ai mainly to generate a bunch of the code, which i hve had to fix some of and after that i am shunning the ai for bad behaviour. I am in some form the architect and chat gpt is my single employee. i give it a blueprint and they do as best as they do while i have to fix all the problems they create.


Currently there is no finished product, So to test this program you will be needed to download godot 4, import the program and launch the game. you can do so by pressing **f5** on your keyboard or the right-pointing triangle in the top right of the godot application.
