A CookieClicker clone made with godot 4 engine.

The goal is to create a simple game as a school project
The targeted audience is everyone, The game will be able to sit in the background for the player to check in once in a while and watch the numbers grow. It's pure seratonin (Fun chemicals)
It's functionality is as a game. You launch it and play it by clicking on different buttons.





The project should include the most basic features from cookie clicker like the ability to click a button to increase a counter that will be used to buy "buildings" or "upgrades" so that you can gain money or in this case Cookies.
I also plan to have som form of background music and the ability to wipe all the save data.
There is also going to be an autosave feature that saves your progress.
